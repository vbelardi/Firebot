# ðŸ”¥ Firebot

**Firebot** is a mobile robot developed during an EPFL project. It showcases the integration of perception, planning, and control using both classical algorithms and lightweight machine learning.

## Features

- **Computer Vision** â€” Detects obstacles in the environment using a camera.
- **Path Planning** â€” Plans a collision-free path to a target location.
- **Kalman Filtering** â€” Fuses position given by camera with wheel encoders for accurate state estimation.
- **Neural Network for Local Avoidance** â€” A reduced-size neural network ensures reactive navigation around nearby obstacles.
